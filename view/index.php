		<h1>Welcome to your Budgeting and Spending Tracker</h1>
		<p>
			<b>BGI (Budget Gateway Interface)</b><br/>
			This simple software is designed to help you keep track of 
			your spending habits, and to provide helpful metrics to 
			inform you about how you can curb your bad habits and 
			develop better ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			This software requires your effort! It does not tie to any 
			bank account directly or integrate with payment services in 
			any way. You must enter your own finances to reap the results.
			Think of this as your online checkbook, but with more charts,
			graphs, and measurements.
